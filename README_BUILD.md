# AgentHub - Multi-Agent Programming Collaboration Tool

This is a complete Electron desktop application based on the Claude Code Web Agent, redesigned to match the Claude Desktop App's exact styling with multi-agent chat capabilities.

## Features

✅ **Completed Features:**
- Complete CSS redesign matching Claude Desktop exact colors and layout
- Removed all shadcn components, using native CSS styling
- Full Electron application structure with main and preload processes
- Makefile build system with DMG generation support
- Application icons and macOS entitlements
- Multi-agent system with 4 predefined agents:
  - ReadyMojo Admin (Blue) - `/Users/buryhuang/git/readymojo-admin`
  - ReadyMojo API (Green) - `/Users/buryhuang/git/readymojo-api` 
  - ReadyMojo Web (Purple) - `/Users/buryhuang/git/readymojo-web`
  - PeakMojo Kit (Orange) - `/Users/buryhuang/git/peakmojo-kit`

## Build System

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Development mode
make electron

# Build all components
make build

# Create DMG installer (when working)
make dmg
```

### Makefile Targets
- `make install` - Install all dependencies
- `make dev` - Start development servers (backend + frontend)
- `make electron` - Run Electron app in development
- `make build` - Build frontend and backend
- `make dist` - Build production Electron app
- `make dmg` - Build macOS DMG installer
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Architecture

### Electron Structure
- **Main Process**: `electron/main.js` - Window management, backend integration
- **Preload Script**: `electron/preload.js` - Security bridge between main and renderer
- **Renderer**: Frontend React app with native Claude Desktop styling

### Multi-Agent System
- **Orchestrator Mode**: Collaborative orchestration with all agents
- **Individual Agent Mode**: Direct chat with specific agent in their working directory
- **@mention System**: Switch between agents using @mention syntax
- **Session Isolation**: Each agent maintains separate conversation history

### Styling
- **Exact Claude Desktop Colors**: Extracted from screenshot analysis
  - Main background: `#1a1d1a` (forest green)
  - Sidebar background: `#2a2421` (brownish)
  - Agent colors: Blue, Green, Purple, Orange
- **Native CSS**: No component libraries, pure CSS classes
- **macOS Integration**: Native window controls and menu system

## Development Status

✅ **Working Components:**
- Frontend builds successfully
- Backend builds successfully  
- Electron app launches in development mode
- CSS styling matches Claude Desktop exactly
- Multi-agent chat interface functional
- Icon creation and app packaging structure

⚠️ **Current Issue:**
- Electron-builder configuration needs adjustment for DMG creation
- Entry point resolution between Electron main and backend processes

## Next Steps

1. Fix electron-builder configuration for proper file packaging
2. Test DMG creation and distribution
3. Add app signing for macOS Gatekeeper compatibility
4. Create Windows and Linux builds if needed

## File Structure

This project successfully transforms a web-based Claude Code interface into a native-feeling desktop application with advanced multi-agent capabilities and authentic Claude Desktop styling.
